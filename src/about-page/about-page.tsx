    desc: "Zammy Zaif is an best google SEO Expert from India residing in Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu who has had phenomenal success with SEO, especially placing first on Google for a competitive term like Google Ranking Expert. He achieved this world-class position in a short period of time since he is a dedicated SEO specialist and also because of his amazing hard work and smart work. When Google PageRank first appeared on the scene, Zammy Zaif began his profession in SEO around the same time. He rapidly understood that Search Engine Optimization will play a significant role in his professional future. His huge achievement came only after experiencing a lot of suffering and hardship. People used to call Zammy a Computer Genius when he was a kid. He had about 15 cousins in his house because he belonged to a joint family. When all of his cousins just learned how to play games on the computer, little Zammy performed more than that. He used to modify the computer password that his uncle had set in order to prevent the youngsters from using it. He was the naughty one in his family, changing the password every time his uncle uncovered it.",

Young Zammy reasoned that because a computer is an electronic machine, obtaining a Diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering would help him reach his goal and he enrolled in a college for the same. Later on, he discovered that he needed to major in Information Technology or Computer Science Engineering in order to get the position he had always aspired to. But it was too late for him to change his major and he had to drop out in the third year influenced by financial difficulties. Following that, he enrolled in a three-month hardware and networking certification course. Over time, he developed into an expert in his area and he attracted consumers from all over the world. He used his hard-earned money to re-enrol in the same engineering course, which he finished successfully the following year with a different batch.",
